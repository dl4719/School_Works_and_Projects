1. In this milestone I created three sorting algormithms, each responsible with sorting data from the appointment 
structure. 

// Sort the patients appointment in chronologic order
void bubbleSort(struct Appointment* appoints, int max);
	The purpose of this function is to sort the appointments array and searches the indices for any patientNumber 
that is zero. The purpose of this is to not only to put the empty indices closer to the end of the array but when 
removing an appointment, it creates an empty space that caused issues in the program. This makes sure that the empty 
spot is removed and put outside of the at the end of the array to prevent printing issues. If an empty spot is left 
in between the data, when the user decides to add a appointment, this spot will immediately be filled but will not
be sorted into the correct spot, making the output incorrect.

// Sort the patients appointment times in chronologic order
void bubbleSortTime(struct Appointment* appoints, int max);
	The purpose of this function is to sort the appointments array from earliest to latest. This is acheived by 
sorting the array by minutes then hours. This ignores the date of the appointments and ensures that the array is 
sorted by time with minutes being sorted by 0 near the beginning of the array to 30 after no more minutes with 0
remain. The sorting is done in this order because for this function to be modular, it should be able to handle more 
specific times allowing it to not only be flexible but suits the users needs what ever that may be.

// Sort the patients appointment dates in chronologic order
void bubbleSortDate(struct Appointment* appoints, int max);
	The purpose of this function is to sort the appointments array from earliest to latest via dates. This is 
acheived by sorting the dates by days first, months, then years. it is done in this order because there can be 
multiple appointments made with the same times but at different days. The same goes for sorting months, there can 
be multiple appointments that are one the same day number but on a different month and the same is for years. In other 
words, the sorting goes from specific dates to more general dates. Like in the previous explainations of the other 
functions, this function is supposed to be modular and suit the users needs.

2. The scanf functions were significantly minimized as the funtions created and defined in previous milestones were 
created, the funtions can be used in this milestone to reduce repetative portions needing user inputs and the same 
or similar error checking. Take the function inputIntRange() for example, this function returns an integer and 
receives two integers as its arguments, the first being an integer for a minimum value and the second being an integer 
for a maximum value. This function reduces repetative error checking structures for menus appointment times and dates.
Functions like inputCString can be used for inputs like the name of a patients and make sure that the name entered 
is in range of the character limit, to prevent long and unecessary names to be entered in the array, preventing 
overflow of the data type. These existing functions created from previous milestones also implement other helpful 
functions like the clearInputBuffer() function which is already added into functions like inputIntPositive(), 
inputCString(), inputCharOption(), and may others to clear inputs to prevent bufferoverflow which can cause unwanted 
outputs.

3. For all three functions mentioned in question one, they are placed in the function viewAllAppointments(). The 
sorting algorithms are in order, bubbleSort(), bubbleSortTime(), bubbleSortDate(). The purpose of the functions in 
this order is to prevent incorrect sorting. If the sorting order were to be date, time then empty arrays, the output 
would not be appointments ordered from earliest to latest appointments, the result would be messy as you would have 
dates that are scheduled for the year 2027 be first on the list and dates as soon as 2024 near the bottom, which 
does not make sense to have a list ordered like this. The way all data should be ordered is first by specifics, in 
this case we want to sort the array to filter out empty array indices at any point when the list is displayed. Next 
is the time in minutes as there can be 60 possibilities as there is 60 values for the minute variable to have. Once 
time has been sorted, the months and years can be sorted without the need to worry about empty array indices being 
sorted to the beginning of the array because the values for time and date are numerically lower than the wanted data.
